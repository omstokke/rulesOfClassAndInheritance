# rulesOfInheritance-aStoryOfClasses
It goes: Life, domain, kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species

To run the Person Simulator (alpha) - 
 - Modules personTables/-Functions/-Classes are needed
 - Run personSimulation.py

Comments will be amended (sorry about that), but a short summary:
 - This is an exercise in creating classes, and the structures of OOP
 - Everything is written for the sake of trying out a specific aspect of Python3-classes
 - This is not necessarily an exercise in clean code (yet)

Same rules as from learning the first steps: I can copy instructions and code, smaller prompts and challenges from the tutorials - but not copy blindly larger construction and projects. As long as the basic functions and building blocks are understood, use tutorials as inspiration, but don't copy the same scope and result (try to expand).

The code in this repository is for learning what I now think is called OOP in Python3, keywords being "Class" - "Subclass" - "Inheritance" and something about magic functions.
