# rulesOfInheritance-aStoryOfClasses
It goes: Life, domain, kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species

Same rules as before: Copy instructions and code, smaller prompts and challenges from the tutorials - but do not copy blindly larger construction and projects. As long as the basic functions and building blocks are understood, use tutorials as inspiration, but don't copy the same scope and result (try to expand).

The code in this repository is for learning what I now think is called OOP in Python3, keywords being "Class" - "Subclass" - "Inheritance" and something about magic functions.
