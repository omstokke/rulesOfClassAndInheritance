#To build and expand upon the tutorials given by Mike and Mosh, Corey Schafer explains in more detail
#Addendum: Trust in Corey - He explains the stuff good-like, and with a nice drawl

#The following sort of deviates from the rule of trying not to copy too much, but the explainations from Corey are too good to be simplified and messed around with.
#The other programs in this repository will be more in the geist of the rules.
